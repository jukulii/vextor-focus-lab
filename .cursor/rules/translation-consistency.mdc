# Rule Name: translation-consistency.mdc
# Description: Ensures all user-facing text added to the frontend is immediately translated in `src/contexts/languagecontext.tsx` for all supported languages.

rules:
- All user-facing text in frontend components/pages (src/components, src/pages, etc.) MUST use the `t()` function provided by `LanguageContext`.
- When introducing any new user-facing text (e.g., button labels, messages, placeholders, titles):
    1. Create a descriptive and unique translation key (e.g., `confirm_delete_button`, `user_profile_title`, `invalid_email_error`).
    2. Use the key with the `t()` function in the component code (e.g., `<Button>{t('confirm_delete_button')}</Button>`).
    3. **Immediately and automatically** edit the `src/contexts/languagecontext.tsx` file.
    4. Add the newly created key to the translation objects for **every language** defined within that file.
    5. Set the initial translation value for the new key in *all* languages to the English version of the text (or a sensible default if English is not the base).
- This process MUST be followed for *every* new piece of user-facing text.
- Do NOT ask the user for confirmation before adding the keys to `src/contexts/languagecontext.tsx`.
- Avoid hardcoding any user-facing strings directly in the components.

context:
- src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx
- src/components/
- src/pages/
