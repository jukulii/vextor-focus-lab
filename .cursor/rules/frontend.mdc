rules:
- Use React with functional components and hooks.
- Always use TypeScript with strict types enabled.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Add JSDoc comments for all exported functions and components.
- Avoid inline styles â€” use Tailwind classes or CSS Modules.
- When creating reusable UI components, use clear props interfaces.
- Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices (e.g. proper labels, roles).
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use `useEffect` with clear dependency arrays and proper cleanup.
- For animations or transitions, use libraries compatible with React (e.g. Framer Motion).
- Prefer `const` over `let` and avoid mutating state directly.
